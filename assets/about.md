        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently studying Computer Science at ADA University, where I was admitted with a strong
          overall GPA after completing grades 10 and 11 at the ADA School. Alongside my academic path, I
          am developing my skills as a graphic designer, a field in which I am still new but progressing
          quickly. I actively balance design with programming, continuously learning and exploring both
          areas. I consider myself a fast learner and a creative thinker, always motivated to build
          something meaningful. In the future, I aim to combine graphic design and programming to create
          innovative digital experiences and unique products.
